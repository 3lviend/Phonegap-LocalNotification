PHONEGAP LOCALNOTIFICATION 
The Phonegap LocalNotification plugin is great, but the documentation is lacking - also explanation of how to do more than set a 60 second timer.

This example goes through in detail how to set a timer for the future based on hours and minutes, as well as days in the future.

It also explains how to create a callback to your app when it is launched from that notification.
